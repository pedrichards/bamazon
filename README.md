# BAMAZON/BEAMAZIN

##Problem
The app's intention is to allow users to place orders from an inventory of items, while updating the inventory to reflect reductions for items bought by users

##Overview
The app is split into several files. There's a mysql and a javascript file, including several npm packages. There's a way to enter an item available for sale after seeing the list therof. The user will be notified whether or not the sale is completed and asked to choose to exit or restart the application.

##Instructions
The user to operate the program must open mysql, and initialize the database. The user must install the npm packages mysql, and inquirer. From there, the user must enter, at the terminal "node bamazonCustomer.js" and proceed from there a javascript file provides information to the command line terminal about items available, their cost, their names, their departments, and a unique id for each item. The user then enters the id of the items they want to buy and the quantity they would like to purchase. After receiving a confirmation if there is enough inventory, or an alert noting that inventory is not high enough, the user will be prompted to begin again, or exit the program.
